# Project Report: Design of an Asynchronous Modulo-10 Counter

This repository contains a PDF report for the project on designing an **asynchronous modulo-10 counter**.  
The report includes theoretical background, specifications, state diagrams, transition tables, simplified logic expressions, and simulations.

## Table of Contents
